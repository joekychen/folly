<h2><code>folly/SmallLocks.h</code></h2>

<p>This module is currently x64 only.</p>

<p>This header defines two very small mutex types.  These are useful in
highly memory-constrained environments where contention is unlikely.
The purpose of these is to allow fine-grained locking in massive data
structures where memory is at a premium.  Often, each record may have
a spare bit or byte lying around, so sometimes these can be tacked on
with no additional memory cost.</p>

<p>There are two types exported from this header.  <code>MicroSpinLock</code> is a
single byte lock, and <code>PicoSpinLock</code> can be wrapped around an
integer to use a single bit as a lock.  Why do we have both?
Because you can't use x64 <code>bts</code> on a single byte, so
<code>sizeof(MicroSpinLock)</code> is smaller than <code>sizeof(PicoSpinLock)</code> can
be, giving it some use cases.</p>

<p>Both the locks in this header model the C++11 Lockable concept.  So
you can use <code>std::lock_guard</code> or <code>std::unique_lock</code> to lock them in an
RAII way if you want.</p>

<p>Additional information is in the header.</p>
